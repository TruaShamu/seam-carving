watch my yt video on object removal:

- [x] energy matrix
- [x] seam finding (vertical)
- [x] seam finding (horizontal)
- [x] draw seam
- [x] remove seam
- [x] resize based on desired width and height
- [x] object removal
- [x] object protection
- [ ] seam insertion
- [ ] gui app for demo purposes.
- [ ] see if i can make like autogenerated gifs of seam carving process (done-ish, got an ffmpeg script)
- [ ] separate rendering and logic portions for cleanness
- [ ] speed optimization (partially done)
- [ ] performance evaluation
- [ ] 100% guaranteed object removal (i.e. minimal amount of seams to remove so the mask is completely removed)
- [ ] make this into a library
- [ ] resize to any size (i.e. one axis needs to have added seams, the other removed seams)
- [ ] allow users to pass in their own energy function

Project limitations:
1. Implementation is limited to the original paper, not the later published paper
2. Energy function used is dual gradient energy function, not entrophy or hog.
3. No transport map for optimized seam removal order.
4. No poisson solver.

todo: theres a bug, the last batch for widening needs to be limited to the number of seams remaining to add.
